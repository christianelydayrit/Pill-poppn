# Pill-poppn

This system integrates an IoT-based automatic pill dispenser, featuring a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing mobile application. It supports an unlimited number of alarms, allowing the dispenser to trigger at the right time. Additionally, the system provides notifications when pills are dispensed and tracks the quantity of pills in each container, notifying users when the pill count reaches a "low" or "full" threshold.

The mobile app enables users to easily rename each container for easier identification. Arduino controls the dispensing mechanism, ensuring accurate timing and automatic pill counting. The system updates the pill count in real-time through Firebase Realtime Database, ensuring that every action is synchronized and no pill is missed.
